      "Went to my first COVID funeral recently, for an extended family member. Following social distancing guidelines, I skipped the indoor viewing and only went to the outdoor graveside service. Upon arriving, I found that I and my immediate family were the only people at the funeral wearing masks. Ok, it‚Äôs outside, so in the interest of family togetherness I tell myself it‚Äôs no big deal. But then things got worse. Even though the spouse of the deceased had just barely recovered from the virus and their family group had all recently been exposed, each and every one came up and fucking HUGGED my masked family members! Thankfully they had already received their first vaccinations, so they had a bit of protection. \n",
      "\n",
      "But ol‚Äô unvaccinated me had to ‚Äúrudely‚Äù refuse hugs from my beloved family members at their mother‚Äôs funeral. They looked at me like I was being inhumanly cruel for denying their hugs, insisting she ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt really died of COVID‚Äù even though she quickly deteriorated in the hospital after testing positive then suffering a series of ‚Äúministrokes‚Äù (a known symptom of COVID). I felt like a horrible human being for refusing these hugs, despite the fact that I knew I was behaving in a responsible and safe way. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Democrat I am already a black sheep to this side of my family, so they just saw my actions as consistent with the crazy, horrible person they already think I am. They saw me as trying to make a political statement at a family funeral, not as trying to take sensible precautions to protect myself from a known source of infection by a virus that had just killed their mom and almost taken their dad too. It sure does suck when you try to love and care for people who can‚Äôt see that love for all the blind hatred in their hearts.\n",

When they was no evidence of that they said they were tampered with and so on and so forth. Eventually both companies were threatened with a $billion+ lawsuit from dominion of defamation.

When they was no evidence of that they said they were tampered with and so on and so forth. Eventually both companies were threatened with a $billion+ lawsuit from dominion of defamation. Newsmax in specific had this moment where Liddell who hadn‚Äôt been sued or threatened yet came in the show and spouted nonsense.

If you've ever sat down and watched one of his rallies there is something very interesting that he would do in all of them that you might miss if you were tuned out. Aside from the boilerplate Republican scare tactics and hate mongering, Trump is very good at finding local issues that no one else is talking about. So when he speaks in Maine he brings up fishing disputes with Canada, when he was speaking in North Carolina he went out of his way to recognize the local Native American Lumbee tribe, when he would go to the rust belt he would talk about lost manufacturing jobs. Just dozens of these small little points that fly under a lot of people's radars but that instill a lot of loyalty in the local populations. It doesn't matter that it's all just surface level bullshit, that he had no intention of following through with any of his promises, or that a lot of his actual policies directly contradicted his rally statements. Just the fact that he would talk about the problems at all was enough to make his followers think he actually cares about them\n"
